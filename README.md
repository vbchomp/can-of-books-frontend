**Author**: Heather Bisgaard
**Version**: 1.0.5

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This is a React App utilizing a Node JS server that uses Auth0 to exchange a token to enable Third Party Authentication to authenticate user. The user can then visit the Profile page or the book database.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
1. Used a template to create the React App and initialized react, react-bootstrap, bootstrap and axios.

2. Set up .env file with the backend URL. Also set up a SAMPLE.env file for users.

3. Set up the template for the server and initialized cors, express, dotenv, jsonwebtoken and jwks-rsa.

4. Set up account, then create single page application and back end server information on Auth0.com to get JWKS key.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
React, Node JS, Mongo DB, Mongoose, GitHub, Auth0, JWKS, Trello
